# Jerry - Move the Mouse to a Monitor

Jerry is used to move your mouse pointer to a particular monitor. You can either invoke jerry
through a CLI, or you can bind the CLI commands to shortcuts on your Window Manager.

Jerry only supports devices that use `xrandr` for now.

Download the binary from the releases and run `jerry --help` to learn how to use the tool.
